Installing required libraries on Ubuntu
=======================================

TRIQS has been installed and tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 13.04 and 14.04. Note that
there is a bug in Ubuntu 12.10 (the hdf5 library has been compiled without hdf5
support) so if you are using that version you will have to recompile the hdf5
library. The problem has been reported and is fixed in 13.04.

Install the following packages which are necessary to build TRIQS and use it::

  sudo apt-get install cmake git g++ libgfortran3 gfortran openmpi-bin openmpi-common \
       openmpi-checkpoint libopenmpi-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev libfftw3-dev libgmp-dev \
       hdf5-tools libhdf5-serial-dev python-h5py python-dev python-numpy python-scipy \
       python-virtualenv python-matplotlib doxygen python-tornado python-zmq python-mpi4py python-mako \

Install the boost library on pre-14.04 Ubuntu versions by::

  sudo apt-get install libboost1.48-all-dev

and on Ubuntu 14.04 by::

  sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
