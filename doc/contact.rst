Contributing/Contact
====================

.. note::
   Do not open an issue on github if you have questions regarding the usage of the code
   which are specific to your problem. Consolidate the :ref:`documentation` and the
   :ref:`tutorials` first. Should this not answer your questions, you can get in contact with
   other users and developers via our `Google group <https://groups.google.com/a/flatironinstitute.org/d/forum/triqs>`_.

Issues and feature requests
---------------------------

Please report bugs and feature request directly on the github
`issue page <https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/issues>`_.  In order to make it easier
for us to solve issues please follow these guidelines:

#. In all cases specify which version tag of the application you are using.
   Should you use a specific commit please provide also the git hash.
   Type `git log -1` in the source directory to get the git hash.

#. If you have a problem during the installation, give us information about
   your operating system and the settings you are using. Include the outputs of
   the ``cmake`` and ``make`` commands as well as the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file
   which is in the build directory. Please include these outputs in a
   `gist <http://gist.github.com/>`_ file referenced in the issue.

#. If you are experiencing a problem during the execution of TRIQS,
   provide the minimal script which allows to quickly reproduce the problem.

#. You can use markdown in your issue message. Please use it. In order to show code
   correctly formatted, use a line with three backticks (:literal:`\`\`\``) before
   and after the source code.
