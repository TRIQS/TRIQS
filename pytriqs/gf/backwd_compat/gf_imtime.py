class GfImTime(Gf) : 
    """
    Parameters (KEYWORD argument ONLY)
    ----------
    mesh: MeshImTime, optional
          The mesh of the Green function
          If not present, it will be constructed from 
          the parameters beta, indices, [n_points], [statistic]

    data: numpy.array, optional
          The data of the Gf.
          Must be of dimension mesh.rank + target_rank.
          Incompatible with target_shape

    target_shape: list of int, optional
                  Shape of the target space.
                  Incompatible with data

    is_real: bool
             Is the Green function real valued ?
             If true, and target_shape is set, the data will be real.
             No effect with the parameter data.

    singularity or tail : TailGfXXX, optional
                 One of the singularity of the module 'singularities'
                 If not present singularity is None.

    indices: GfIndices or list of str or list of list of str, Optional
             Optional string indices for the target space, to allow e.g g['eg', 'eg']
             list of list of str: the list of indices for each dimension.
             list of str: all indices are assumed to be the same for all dimensions.
   
    name: str
          The name of the Green function. For plotting.
