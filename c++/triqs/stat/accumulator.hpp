  /// The class takes in measurements during a Monte Carlo simulation and serves a dual purpose:
  ///
  /// (a) It can estimate the auto-correlation time of the data (so-called "logarithmic binning").
  /// (b) It can average groups of consecutive measurements and store the final data (so-called "linear binning").
  ///
  /// The accumulators can be configured to perform either or both of these purposes, as needed. The design is
  /// purposefully flexible -- it is useful both where the auto-correlation time $\tau$ of the data is known as well as
  /// when it has to be estimated during the simulation.
  ///
  /// Logarithmic (Log) Binning
  /// -------------------------
  ///
  /// This part of the accumulator is used to estimate the autocorrelation time of the data, by calculating the standard
  /// error of the data binned with different bin sizes. For correlated data, the error should grow as the bin size
  /// increases up to the autocorrelation time, where it saturates.
  ///
  /// The log binning uses bin sizes that are powers of two $2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots$ up to a user-defined maximum. Note
  /// that binning is performed only once there is at one full bin of data at a given size -- any partial accumulation
  /// is not considered. In the the end, one can obtain the list of standard errors for the different levels of binning;
  /// this should be analyzed to see if saturation with size has occurred.
  ///
  /// .. note:: Underestimating the auto-correlation time and a lack of ergodicity are common sources of systematic
  /// errors in Monte Carlo simulations. Provided the computational and memory costs are acceptable, it is advisable to
  /// always turn on logarithmic binning to check that $\tau$ was estimated correctly and acts as expected.
  ///
  /// Linear (Lin) Binning
  /// --------------------
  ///
  /// This part of the accumulator is responsible for partially averaging (binning) and storing the data. It takes in
  /// data and accumulates it in a bin up to a user-defined bin-size. At every point, a bin stores the mean value of the
  /// data within it bin. If the bin size is larger then the auto-correlation time $\tau$ of the measurement, the bins
  /// are independent statistical samples, which can be used for further analysis.
